This is a project for my Front-End class at The Iron Yard DC.

The goal of this project is to practice writing classes, constructor functions, and methods. By the end of this assignment I should be able to create a new type of object along with child objects that have shared functionality through their prototypes.

The author of this project is Christine Ash.
